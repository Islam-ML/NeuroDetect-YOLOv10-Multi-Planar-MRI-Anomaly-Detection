# NeuroDetect-YOLOv10-Multi-Planar-MRI-Anomaly-Detection
An AI-powered Brain MRI analysis system using YOLOv10. This project trains specialized models on Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal planes to detect anomalies (T1wCE) with high precision. By leveraging multi-view object detection, it automates binary classification (Positive/Negative) for enhanced diagnostic reliability.
